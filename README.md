# MathBuddy1.0

We will create an app that will be used by students in a network of elementary schools to develop their maths skills. These elementary school students will be the end users who’ll be able to exercise their basic maths skills using the app. The app will pose random maths questions to the students and check if they’ve entered the correct answers. The intention is to improve their students’ math competency through the app. We will be creating this app with backend and basic concepts of Java only.
